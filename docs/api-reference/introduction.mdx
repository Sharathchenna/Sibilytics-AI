## HTTP Status Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `200` | Success |
| `400` | Bad Request - Invalid parameters |

## Rate Limiting

Currently no rate limiting is enforced. For production deployments with heavy traffic, consider adding rate limiting at the reverse proxy level.

---

## CORS

The API allows cross-origin requests from:

- `http://localhost:3000`
- `http://localhost:3001`
- `https://sibilytics-ai.in`

Additional origins can be configured in the backend.
