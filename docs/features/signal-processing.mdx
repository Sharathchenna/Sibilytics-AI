## Overview

The Signal Processing module enables you to upload sensor data files, apply wavelet decomposition for denoising, and extract comprehensive statistical features.

## Supported File Formats

| Format | Extension | Delimiter | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| CSV | `.csv` | Comma | Most common format |
| Text | `.txt` | Tab/Space | Auto-detected |
| LabVIEW | `.lvm` | Tab | Special header handling |
| Excel | `.xlsx` | N/A | First sheet is used |
| Compressed | `.csv.gz` | Comma | 50-90% bandwidth savings |

<Tip>
  Headers are auto-detected! You don't need to manually specify if your file has headers.
</Tip>

## Wavelet Decomposition

Sibilytics AI uses **Biorthogonal wavelets** for signal denoising, which are ideal for signal analysis due to their linear phase property.

### Available Wavelet Types

    - bior3.9
  </Card>
</Columns>

Additional wavelets: `bior4.4`, `bior5.5`, `bior6.8`

### Decomposition Levels

You can configure **1 to 20 decomposition levels**. Higher levels provide more denoising but may remove signal details.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="lightbulb" title="How to choose the right level?">
    - **Low levels (1-5)**: Preserve signal details, light denoising
    - **Medium levels (6-12)**: Good balance for most applications
    - **High levels (13-20)**: Aggressive denoising, may blur features
    
    Start with level 5-8 and adjust based on your results.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Extracted Features

The platform extracts 13+ statistical features from both raw and denoised signals:

| Feature | Description | Formula |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Mean** | Average value | Σx / n |
| **Median** | Middle value | Sorted middle element |
| **Standard Deviation** | Spread measure | √(Σ(x-μ)² / n) |
| **Variance** | Squared spread | Σ(x-μ)² / n |
| **Min/Max** | Range bounds | Extrema |
| **Skewness** | Asymmetry measure | Third moment |
| **Kurtosis** | Tail heaviness | Fourth moment |
| **Entropy** | Information content | -Σp·log(p) |
| **RMS** | Root Mean Square | √(Σx² / n) |
| **Peak-to-Peak** | Amplitude range | max - min |
| **Crest Factor** | Peak to RMS ratio | peak / RMS |
| **MSE** | Mean Squared Error | Σ(x-x̂)² / n |
| **SNR** | Signal-to-Noise Ratio | 10·log₁₀(Ps/Pn) |

## LTTB Downsampling

For large files (800,000+ data points), Sibilytics AI uses the **Largest-Triangle-Three-Buckets (LTTB)** algorithm to downsample data for visualization while preserving visual features.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="bolt" title="Why LTTB?">
    - **O(n) time complexity** - Fast even for huge datasets
    - **Preserves visual features** - Peaks and valleys are retained
    - **Target: 15,000 points** - Optimal for Plotly rendering
    - **Original data preserved** - Statistics use full dataset

## Batch Processing

Process multiple files at once and download consolidated statistics:

1. Upload multiple signal files
2. Configure wavelet settings (applied to all files)
3. Click "Process All"
4. Download consolidated CSV with all file statistics

<Note>
  Batch processing results include filename in each row for easy identification.
